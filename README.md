# ✋ Hand Gesture Object Control 🖱️

This Python project uses **MediaPipe** to detect hand landmarks and control an object (represented by a blue rectangle) based on the distance between the **index finger** and **middle finger**. The object moves to the position of the index finger when the fingers are close enough. The program provides a real-time visual feedback of your hand's position and the rectangle's movement. 🤖🎮
